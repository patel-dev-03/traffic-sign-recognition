 <br> [Training DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign). <br>
 
 <br> For directly accessing the model run [GUI.py](https://github.com/patel-dev-03/traffic-sign-recognition/blob/main/gui.py) file with required Tensorflow library in Python. It will run the [my_model_final.h5](https://github.com/patel-dev-03/traffic-sign-recognition/blob/main/my_model_final.h5) in your local machine. <br>
